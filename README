A work-in-progress compiler that promises no functionality.

Currently of interest is a barebones implementation of printf in C that
promintently features mostly-working floating-point printing support, a
simple tokenizer, a robust implementation of the shunting-yard algorithm, and
an arithmetic-expression compiler that supports both integer and floating-point
expressions that compiles to native x86 assembly.

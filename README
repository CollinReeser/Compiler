The development environment for this compiler is set up as such: When initially 
cloning the repository, clone it inside a folder called "gitCompiler" inside 
your actual working environment. 

Use the command, while inside "gitCompiler", 

"git clone git@github.com:CollinReeser/Compiler.git"

Then, copy everything but the ".git" folder to 
your outer working directory, which should be one level up. From here, you 
should be able to "make commit" and "make pull" inside the working directory, 
where the inner git directory is updated correctly and updates your working 
directory accordingly.

I recongize that this is incredibly foobar and at some point I will fix this so 
that it actually makes any sense. I developed this system in tandem with 
learning the absolute basics of git, and since it works, I fear for breaking it.
